This is a small game which i called Airplane.
The code is far from ideal of course, but the results i pretty much like.
You`ve got a star ship represented by triangukarly shaped form, and the 
aseteroid are represented by three constantly falling dots. The aim is 
to avoid asteroid as much as possible and at the same time to try to destroy them.
So the player moves with 'wasd' keys and 'x' to shoot. The game got three levels to it.
On each level additional asteroid will appear thats going to move twice as fast.
The game is written by myself from the scratch without using any aditional libriries such as
directx or opencv or sfml. it means that there is no vertical synchonizations(blinking of the elemets)
